# SUPP

## What's Supp?

Supp is a user-friendly app that sorts users by distance and filters them by common interests/hobbies. Users connect with each other via private chats.

## Technologies

### Front-end
Github:
Front-end 
https://github.com/AlbertCarreras/supp-client

React with Redux & Redux Thunk & React-actioncable-provider
  * **Geolocation Web API** for obtaining userâ€™s current location coordinates

    I used W3C Geolocation standard to request the browser the geolocation of the user. The request returns the latitude and longitude of the user which is persisted and used to georeference other nearby users.

    I research the best approach to obtain the location, and decided to go use the Geolocation Web API after reading the following: 
      >> "Some browsers use IP addresses to detect a user's location. However, it may only provide a rough estimate of a user's location. The W3C >> approach is the easiest and most fully-supported so it should be prioritized over other geolocation methods."
      >> https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/geolocation
    
  * **Custom CSS** and **Semantic UI elements** for front-end design
  
    Most of the app is styled using custom CSS. Some elements such as the icons and the modals are Semantic UI elements.
    I decided to use Semantic UI elements because the library facilitated the front-end styling in previous projects. Moreover, I had in mind using modals and liked the examples from the library. However, I would refactor the modals and use custom CSS. 

  * **Bad-words (package)** for filtering profane language
  
    The search bar and the chat input bar do not allow to look for profane language. It is a very simple package but easily offers functionality to prevent some user behaviors.

### Back-end

Rails API with with serialization and Postgres
  * **Active Storage** for photo storage connected to AWS S3 in production
  
    I used the Rails built-in solution -Active Storage- to attach files to your Active Record models. Active Record also facilitates uploading files to a cloud storage service like Amazon S3.

    The server is hosted in Heroku. In order to deploy to Heroku and upload images, you need to create an AWS S3 account to store the files.
    
    Great resources for implementing Active Storage:

    * https://medium.com/cedarcode/rails-5-2-credentials-9b3324851336

  * **Action Cable** for live private chat feed updating and connected-user indicators
    
      Action Cable is the built-in websocket implementation in Rails. In order to facilitate the websocket connection from the React front-end, I decided to use **react-actioncable-provider (package)**.
      
      __Live private chats__ I implemented a simplified version of private chats that I would refactor into a more sophisticated design in case of real implementation. New conversations are broadcasted to all users with serialized information about the 2 users to whom the conversation belongs to. In the front end, the received conversation is only displayed if one of the users is the logged in user.
    
      __Connected users indicators (blue-green dots)__ When a user logs in, they subscribe to a presence channel changing their status to active in the database  -reversely when disconnecting/unsubscribing. 

      Great resources for implementing websockets in React-Rails apps:
      * https://medium.com/@dakota.lillie/using-action-cable-with-react-c37df065f296
      * https://blog.heroku.com/real_time_rails_implementing_websockets_in_rails_5_with_action_cable

  * **Knock** for JSON Web Token authentication and **cookies** for websocket-connection user identification
  
      I followed the __3.1.1 Connection Setup__ implementation guidelines from the Action Cable Overview documentation. However, I used JWT tokens for authorization. In order to pass the required cookies, the front-end generates a cookie containing the JWT token from localStorage and the server authorize the incoming connection if the user is identified in the JWT token.
    
      Great resources for understanding credentials and deploying master key:
      * https://medium.com/cedarcode/rails-5-2-credentials-9b3324851336
      Great resources for creating cookies in the React front-end:
      * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/cookie
    
  * **Geokit (gem)** for calculating surrounding users to connected user distance
  
      Users are sorted by distance in the front-end. The server responds with an array of users including the distance to the logged-in user. The gem calculates the distance based on the coordinates of each user obtained via Geolocation Web API.

## Acknowledgment

I'm a board game geek. I love playing Dominion, Carcassonne, Star Realms, 7 Wonders, and so forth. I landed in NYC 6 years ago now and have found that it takes a lot of effort to meet and/or "connect" with people to play board games: you have to go to board games stores, your friends live really far, and more. 

At the same time, NYC has so many passionate people out there and is not difficult to find people who love the same things you love. However, despite having apps such as Meetup, I wanted to create a more genuine app to find people who share my same hobbies or passions and who actually live or are regularly nearby; start a conversation, and plan to meet to do those activities or experience them together. 

Supp is an app to enhance the experience of meeting new people and making new friends.
